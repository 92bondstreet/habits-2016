## 21, 30, 66... days for a new habits?

You can find a lot of excellent posts on how to build new habits with tips and scientific ways.

About how long, 21 days, 30 days, 6 months?

The following study [How are habits formed: Modelling habit formation in the real world](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ejsp.674/abstract) help us to understand the time takes more than two months before a new behavior becomes automatic. 66 days to be exact.

That's why I start on 2 months for a new habits.

## Expose them
